# ** EXAM OBJECTIVE: INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION **
# GOAL: Secure a cluster and an index using Elasticsearch Security
# REQUIRED SETUP: (i) a running Elasticsearch cluster with at least one node and a Kibana instance, (ii) no index named `hamlet`
# You can copy-paste the following instructions into your Kibana console and work directly from there

# Enable xPack security on the cluster
# Set the password of the `elastic` and `kibana` built-in users, by using the pattern "{{username}}-password" (e.g., "elastic-password")
# Login to Kibana using the `elastic` user credentials
# Create the index `hamlet` and add some documents by running the following _bulk command
PUT hamlet/_doc/_bulk
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet","_id":0}}
{"line_number":"1","speaker":"BERNARDO","text_entry":"Whos there?"}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet","_id":1}}
{"line_number":"2","speaker":"FRANCISCO","text_entry":"Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself."}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet","_id":2}}
{"line_number":"3","speaker":"BERNARDO","text_entry":"Long live the king!"}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet","_id":3}}
{"line_number":"4","speaker":"FRANCISCO","text_entry":"Bernardo?"}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet","_id":4}}
{"line_number":"5","speaker":"BERNARDO","text_entry":"He."}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet","_id":5}}
{"line_number":"6","speaker":"FRANCISCO","text_entry":"You come most carefully upon your hour."}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet","_id":6}}
{"line_number":"7","speaker":"BERNARDO","text_entry":"Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco."}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet","_id":7}}
{"line_number":"8","speaker":"FRANCISCO","text_entry":"For this relief much thanks: tis bitter cold,"}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet","_id":8}}
{"line_number":"9","speaker":"FRANCISCO","text_entry":"And I am sick at heart."}
{"index":{"_index":"hamlet","_id":9}}
{"line_number":"10","speaker":"BERNARDO","text_entry":"Have you had quiet guard?"}
# Create the security role `francisco_role` in the native realm, so that the role (i) has "monitor" privileges on the cluster, (ii) has all privileges on the `hamlet` index
# Create the user `francisco` with password "francisco-password"
# Assign the role `francisco_role` to the `francisco` user
# Login using the `francisco` user credentials, and run some queries on `hamlet` to verify that the role privileges were correctly set
# Create the security role `bernardo_role` in the native realm, so that the role (i) has "monitor" privileges on the cluster, (ii) has read-only privileges on the `hamlet` index, (iii) can see only those documents having "BERNARDO" as a `speaker`, (iv) can see only the `text_entry` field
# Create the user `bernardo` with password "bernardo-password"
# Assign the role `bernardo_role` to the `bernardo` user
# Login using the `bernardo` user credentials, and run some queries on `hamlet` to verify that the role privileges were correctly set
# Change the password of the `bernardo` user to "poor-bernardo"

# LAB STEPS

Configuration in Node1, Node2 and Node3

xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.verification_mode: certificate 
xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path: certs/elastic-certificates.p12 
xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.path: certs/elastic-certificates.p12 

bin/elasticsearch-certutil ca
(password:elastic)
bin/elasticsearch-certutil cert --ca elastic-stack-ca.p12
(password:elasticsearch)

Copy file to all three nodes:
mkdir /etc/elasticsearch/certs
scp elastic-certificates.p12 node2:/etc/elasticsearch/certs/elastic-certificates.p12
chmod 660 /etc/elasticsearch/certs/elastic-certificates.p12

bin/elasticsearch-keystore add xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.secure_password
bin/elasticsearch-keystore add xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.secure_password
(password:elasticsearch)

Copy keystore file to all three nodes:
scp /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.keystore node2:/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.keystore

systemctl start elasticsearch

/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords 

Kibana.yml:

elasticsearch.username: "elastic"
elasticsearch.password: "elastic"

systemctl start kibana
