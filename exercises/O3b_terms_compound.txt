# ** EXAM OBJECTIVE: QUERIES **
# GOAL: Create search queries for terms, numbers, dates, fuzzy, and compound queries
# REQUIRED SETUP: (i) a running Elasticsearch cluster with at least one node and a Kibana instance, (ii) add the "Sample web logs" and "Sample flight data" to Kibana
# Copy-paste the following instructions into your Kibana Dev Tools, and work directly from there

### Run the next queries on the `kibana_sample_data_logs` index
# Filter documents with the `response` field greater or equal to 400 and less than 500
# As above, but add a second filter for documents with the `referer` field matching the string "http://twitter.com/success/guion-bluford"
# Filter documents with the `referer` field that starts by "http://twitter.com/success"
# Filter documents with the `request` field that starts by "/people"
# Filter documents with the `memory` field containing any indexed value
# (opposite of above) Filter documents with the `memory` field not containing any indexed value
# Search for documents with the `agent` field containing the string "Windows" and the `url` field containing the string "name:john"
# As above, but also filter documents with the `phpmemory` field containing any indexed value
# Search for documents that have either the `response` field greater or equal to 400 or the `tags` field having the string "error"
# Search for documents with the `tags` field that does not contain any of the following strings: "warning", "error", "info"
# Filter documents with the `timestamp` field containing a date between today and one week ago
# Filter documents with the `clientip` field having an IP address in the range "1.0.0.0"-"1.255.255.255"

### Run the next queries on the `kibana_sample_data_flights` index
# Filter documents with either the `OriginCityName` or the `DestCityName` fields matching the string "Sydney"
# As above, but allow inexact fuzzy matching, with a maximum allowed "Levenshtein Edit Distance" set to 2. Test that the query strings "Sydney", "Sidney" and "Sidnei" always return the same number of results
