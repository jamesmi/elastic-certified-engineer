# ** EXAM OBJECTIVE: QUERIES **
# GOAL: Use scroll API, search templates, script queries
# REQUIRED SETUP: (i) a running Elasticsearch cluster with at least one node and a Kibana instance, (ii) add the "Sample web logs" and "Sample flight data" to Kibana
# Copy-paste the following instructions into your Kibana Dev Tools, and work directly from there

# Search for all documents in all indices
# As above, but use the scroll API to return the first 100 results while keeping the search context alive for 2 minutes
# Use the scroll id included in the response to the previous query and retrieve the next batch of results

### Run the next queries on the `kibana_sample_data_logs` index
# Filter documents with (i) the `response` field greater or equal to 400 and less than 500, and (ii) the `tags` field containing the value "security"
# Create a search template for the above query, so that the template (i) is named "with_response_and_tag", (ii) has a parameter "with_min_response" to represent the lower bound of the `response` field, (iii) has a parameter "with_max_response" to represent the upper bound of the `response` field, (iv) has a parameter "with_tag" to represent a possible value of the `tags` field
# Test the "with_response_and_tag" search template by setting the parameters as follows: (i) "with_min_response": 400, (ii) "with_max_response": 500 (iii) "with_tag": "security"
# Update the "with_response_and_tag" search template, so that (i) if the "with_max_response" parameter is not set, then don't set an upper bound to the `response` value, and (ii) if the "with_tag" parameter is not set, then do not apply that second filter at all
# Test the "with_response_and_tag" search template by setting only the "with_min_response" parameter to 500
# Test the "with_response_and_tag" search template by setting the parameters as follows: (i) "with_min_response": 500, (ii) "with_tag": "security"

### Run the next queries on the `kibana_sample_data_flights` index
# Filter documents with the `OriginWeather` and `DestWeather` fields set to the same value
